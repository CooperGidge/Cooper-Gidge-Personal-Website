I’ve always had an appreciation for those who give their work to the world. Whether that be through [creative commons licenses](), sharing your work on sites like [Unsplash](), or just giving your work away for free, there are many people who appreciate it. And I am one of those people.

While most of the resources on this site are published on sites like Unsplash which use a [CC0 licence](), despite not having to give attribution, I thought that it was the least I can do. Therefore, I will use this page to share the creators of external work I use on this site, as well as work I use on other places I am found.

This photo “Brown Wooden Round Analog Wall Clock” is by [ritonn.photo on Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/wood-earth-forest-vintage-5740996/). Once again, I really like the composition of this one. And it’s a nice looking clock.
