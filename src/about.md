I am a programmer that specializes in software development. I also do creative writing and web development as hobbies.

Honestly, this website is going to be a mess. It is going to represent myself, and I am okay with a bit of messiness. While I like to plan ahead, I also like to take things as they come.

Expect this place to house my thoughts and projects, but also expect the unexpected. Afterall, this website is pretty much just [my digital playground](https://css-tricks.com/make-it-personal/).
